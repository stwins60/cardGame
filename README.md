Based on the provided information, since there are no specific code changes to the README.md file in the Pull Request and the only commit message related to README update is 'Auto-generated commit for README update', we can assume that there are no new updates or changes needed for the README file.

The existing README file content is as follows:
```
Card Game
```

Since the README content is minimal, I suggest expanding the README to provide information about the project. Here is a suggestion for an updated README based on the available information:

```
